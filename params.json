{"name":"Zip","tagline":"","body":"Zip 3.0 is the first Zip update adding large file support.  For now Zip 2.3x\r\nremains available and supported, but users should switch to this new release.\r\n\r\nTesting for Zip 3.0 has focused mainly on Unix, VMS, Max OS X, and Win32,\r\nand some other ports may not be fully supported yet.  If you find your\r\nfavorite port is broke, send us the details or, better, send bug fixes.  It's\r\npossible that support for some older ports may be dropped in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 1990-2008 Info-ZIP.  All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nSee the accompanying file LICENSE (the contents of which are also included\r\nin unzip.h, zip.h and wiz.h) for terms of use.  If, for some reason, all\r\nof these files are missing, the Info-ZIP license also may be found at:\r\nftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html and\r\nhttp://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nZip 3.0 is a compression and file packaging utility.  It is compatible with\r\nPKZIP 2.04g (Phil Katz ZIP) for MSDOS systems.  There is a companion to zip\r\ncalled unzip (of course) which you should be able to find in the same place\r\nyou got zip.  See the file 'WHERE' for details on ftp sites and mail\r\nservers.\r\n\r\nSo far zip has been ported to a wide array of Unix and other mainframes,\r\nminis, and micros including VMS, OS/2, Minix, MSDOS, Windows, Atari, Amiga,\r\nBeOS and VM/CMS.  Although highly compatible with PKware's PKZIP and PKUNZIP\r\nutilities of MSDOS fame, our primary objective has been one of portability\r\nand other-than-MSDOS functionality.  Features not found in the PKWare version\r\ninclude creation of zip files in a pipe or on a device; VMS, BeOS and OS/2\r\nextended file attributes; conversion from Unix to MSDOS text file format; and,\r\nof course, the ability to run on most of your favorite operating systems.  And\r\nit's free.\r\n\r\nSee the file zip30.ann for a summary of new features in Zip 3.0 and WhatsNew\r\nfor the detailed list of new features and changes since Zip 2.32.  The file\r\nCHANGES details all day-to-day changes during development.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nMulti-volume support.  This version does not support multi-volume spanned\r\narchives as in pkzip 2.04g, and there is no intention at this point to support\r\nspanned archives, but Zip 3.0 supports split archives.  A split archive is an\r\narchive split into a set of files, each file a piece of the archive and each\r\nfile using an extension, such as .z02 as in the file name archive.z02, that\r\nprovides the order of the splits.  In contrast, a spanned archive is the\r\noriginal multi-floppy archive supported by pkzip 2.0g where the split order\r\nis contained in the volume labels.  The contents of split and spanned archives\r\nare mostly identical and there is a simple procedure to convert between the\r\nformats.  Many current unzips now support split archives.\r\n\r\nZip64 support.  This version supports Zip64 archives as described in the\r\nPKWare AppNote.  These archives use additional fields to support archives\r\ngreater than 2 GB and files in archives over the 2 GB previous limit (4 GB\r\non some ports).  The Zip64 format also allows more than 64k entries in an\r\narchive.  Support by the OS for files larger than 4 GB is needed for Zip to\r\ncreate and read large files and archives.  On Unix, Win32, and some other\r\nports, large file and Zip64 support is automatically checked for and\r\ncompiled in if available.  Use of Zip64 by Zip is automatic and to maximize\r\nbackward compatibility the Zip64 fields will only be used if needed.  A\r\nZip64 archive requires a pkzip 4.5 compatible unzip, such as UnZip 6.0.\r\n\r\nUnicode support.  This version has initial Unicode support.  This allows\r\npaths and names of files in other character sets to be accurately recreated\r\non OS that have sufficient character set support.  On Win32, if wide\r\ncharacter calls are supported (not Win 9x unless Unicode support has been\r\nadded) all files (including paths with illegal characters in the current\r\ncharacter set) should now be readable by zip.  Unicode support is provided\r\nusing a new set of UTF-8 path and comment extra fields and a new UTF-8 bit\r\nfor flagging when the current character set is already UTF-8.  Zip 3.0\r\nmaintains backward compatibility with older archives and is mostly compliant\r\nwith the new Unicode additions in the latest PKWare AppNote.  The exception\r\nis UTF-8 comments, which are not supported if UTF-8 is not the native\r\ncharacter set, but should be fully implemented in Zip 3.1.\r\n\r\n16-bit OS support.  Though Zip 3.0 is designed to support the latest zip\r\nstandards and modern OS, some effort has been made to maintain support\r\nfor older and smaller systems.  If you find Zip 3.0 does not fit on or\r\notherwise does not work well on a particular OS, send in the details and\r\nwe might be able to help.\r\n\r\nCompression methods.  In addition to the standard store and deflate methods,\r\nZip now can use the bzip2 compression format using the bzip2 library.  Though\r\nbzip2 compression generally takes longer, in many cases using bzip2 results\r\nin much better compression.  However, many unzips may not yet support\r\nbzip2 compressed entries in archives, so test your unzip first before using\r\nbzip2 compression.\r\n\r\nInstallation.  Please read the file INSTALL for information on how to compile\r\nand install zip, zipsplit, zipcloak, and zipnote and please read the manual\r\npages ZIP.txt, ZIPSPLIT.txt, ZIPCLOAK.txt, and ZIPNOTE.txt for information on\r\nhow to use them.  Also, if you are using MSDOS or Windows, note that text\r\nfiles in the distribution are generally in Unix line end format (LF only)\r\nand Windows and DOS users will need to either convert the files as needed to\r\nDOS line ends (CR LF) or extract the distribution contents using unzip -a.\r\n\r\nUtilities.  At this point zipsplit, zipcloak, and zipnote should work with\r\nlarge files, but they currently do not handle split archives.  A work around\r\nis to use zip to convert a split archive to a single file archive and then use\r\nthe utilities on that archive.\r\n\r\nEncryption.  This version supports standard zip encryption.  Until recently\r\nthe encryption code was distributed separately because of the US export\r\nregulations but now is part of the main distribution.  See crypt.c for\r\ndetails.  Decryption can be made with unzip 5.0p1 or later, or with zipcloak.\r\n\r\nBug reports.  All bug reports or patches should go to zip-bugs via the web\r\nsite contact form at http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html (we have discontinued\r\nthe old email address zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu because of too much spam lately)\r\nand suggestions for new features can be submitted there also (although we don't\r\npromise to use all of them).  We also are on SourceForge at\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/ and now automatically get Bug Reports\r\nand Feature Requests submitted there.  In addition, a new Info-ZIP discussion\r\nforum is available as well.  See below.  Though bug reports can be posted there,\r\nwe don't have automatic monitoring of all postings set up yet so you may want\r\nto use the web form or SoureForge for a quicker response.  A good approach may\r\nbe to post the details on the forum so others can benefit from the posting,\r\nthen use the web reply form to let us know you did that if you don't get a\r\nreply in a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nPorts.  If you're considering a port, please check in with zip-bugs FIRST,\r\nsince the code is constantly being updated behind the scenes.  We'll\r\narrange to give you access to the latest source.\r\n\r\nDiscussion group.  If you'd like to keep up to date with our Zip (and companion\r\nUnZip utility) development, join the ranks of BETA testers, add your own\r\nthoughts and contributions, etc., check out the new discussion forum.  This is\r\nthe latest offering, after the various Info-ZIP mailing-lists on\r\nmxserver@lists.wku.edu (courtesy of Hunter Goatley) were no longer available\r\nand the temporary QuickTopic discussion group for Info-ZIP issues at\r\nhttp://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/V6ZQZ54uKNL died a horrible death due to large\r\namounts of spam.  The new discussion forum is now available at\r\nhttp://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl (thanks again to Hunter Goatley) and\r\ncan be used to discuss issues, request features, and is one place new betas\r\nand releases are announced.  It also is a place to post bug reports, and\r\npatches can be submitted as attachments.  However, we don't yet get\r\nautomatic notification of all postings there so try one of the other methods\r\nif you don't get a response.  You can also post Bug Reports and Feature\r\nRequests at Source Forge.  However, the web site contact form remains\r\navailable if you would rather not post on the public forums.\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions on zip and unzip:\r\n\r\nQ. When unzipping I get an error message about \"compression method 8\".\r\n\r\nA. This is standard deflate, which has been around for awhile.  Please\r\n   get a current version of unzip.  See the file 'WHERE' for details.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. How about \"compression method 12\"?\r\n\r\nA. Compression method 12 is bzip2 and requires a relatively modern unzip.\r\n   Please get the latest version of unzip.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. I can't extract this zip file that I just downloaded.  I get\r\n   \"zipfile is part of multi-disk archive\" or some other message.\r\n\r\nA. Please make sure that you made the transfer in binary mode.  Check\r\n   in particular that your copy has exactly the same size as the original.\r\n   Note that the above message also may actually mean you have only part\r\n   of a multi-part archive.  Also note that UnZip 5.x does not and UnZip 6.0\r\n   probably won't have multi-disk (split) archive support.  A work around\r\n   is to use Zip 3.0 to convert the split archive to a single-file archive\r\n   then use UnZip on that archive.  As a last result, if there's something\r\n   readable in what you have, zip -FF should be able to recover it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. When running unzip, I get a message about \"End-of-central-directory\r\n   signature not found\".\r\n\r\nA. This usually means that your zip archive is damaged, or that you\r\n   have an uncompressed file with the same name in the same directory.\r\n   In the first case, it makes more sense to contact the person you\r\n   obtained the zip file from rather than the Info-ZIP software\r\n   developers, and to make sure that your copy is strictly identical to\r\n   the original.  In the second case, use \"unzip zipfile.zip\" instead\r\n   of \"unzip zipfile\", to let unzip know which file is the zip archive\r\n   you want to extract.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Why doesn't zip do <something> just like PKZIP does?\r\n\r\nA. Zip is not a PKZIP clone and is not intended to be one.  In some\r\n   cases we feel PKZIP does not do the right thing (e.g., not\r\n   including pathnames by default); in some cases the operating system\r\n   itself is responsible (e.g., under Unix it is the shell which\r\n   expands wildcards, not zip).  Info-ZIP's and PKWARE's zipfiles\r\n   are interchangeable, not the programs.\r\n\r\n   For example, if you are used to the following PKZIP command:\r\n               pkzip -rP foo *.c\r\n   you must use instead on Unix:\r\n               zip -R foo \"*.c\"\r\n   (the quotes are needed to let the shell know that it should\r\n    not expand the *.c argument but instead pass it on to the program,\r\n    but are not needed on ports that do not expand file paths like\r\n    MSDOS)\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Can I distribute zip and unzip sources and/or executables?\r\n\r\nA. You may redistribute the latest official distributions without any\r\n   modification, without even asking us for permission. You can charge\r\n   for the cost of the media (CDROM, diskettes, etc...) and a small copying\r\n   fee.  If you want to distribute modified versions please contact us at\r\n   www.Info-ZIP.org first. You must not distribute beta versions.\r\n   The latest official distributions are always on ftp.Info-ZIP.org in\r\n   directory /pub/infozip and subdirectories and at SourceForge.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Can I use the executables of zip and unzip to distribute my software?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, so long as it is made clear in the product documentation that\r\n   zip or unzip are not being sold, that the source code is freely\r\n   available, and that there are no extra or hidden charges resulting\r\n   from its use by or inclusion with the commercial product.  See the\r\n   Info-ZIP license for more.  Here is an example of a suitable notice:\r\n\r\n     NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's compression\r\n     utility.  The installation program uses UnZip to read zip files from\r\n     the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip, UnZip and related utilities) is\r\n     freely distributed under the Info-ZIP license and can be obtained as\r\n     source code or executables from various anonymous-ftp sites,\r\n     including ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Can I use the source code of zip and unzip in my commercial application?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, as long as the conditions in the Info-ZIP license are met.  We\r\n   recommend you include in your product documentation an acknowledgment\r\n   and note that the original compression sources are available at\r\n   www.Info-ZIP.org. If you have special requirements contact us.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
